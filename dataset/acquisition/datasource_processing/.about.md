# Datasource Processing Module

This module is responsible for extracting text from captured screenshots and PDF files using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for images and direct text extraction for PDFs, then cleaning the extracted text for further use.

## Features

- **OCR Text Extraction**: Uses Tesseract OCR to extract text from PNG/TIFF image files.
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Uses PyPDF2 to extract text directly from PDF files.
- **Text Cleaning**: Includes functionalities to clean extracted text, such as removing control characters, fixing "stuck words" (e.g., "HelloWorld" to "Hello World"), and optionally performing grammar and spelling checks using `language_tool_python`.
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes multiprocessing to process multiple files concurrently for improved performance.
- **Input Flexibility**: Can process single files or all files within a specified directory.
- **Output to Text Files**: Saves the processed text into `.txt` files, mirroring the input directory structure.
- **Progress Spinner**: Provides visual feedback during processing for a better user experience.

## Usage

This module can be run as part of the EMTP pipeline or executed standalone.

### As Part of EMTP Pipeline

This module is automatically called by the main EMTP pipeline (`python main.py`) as the third stage. It processes screenshots from `dataset/acquisition/temp/screenshots/` and saves the extracted text to `dataset/acquisition/temp/text_data/`.

### Standalone Usage

```bash
# Process all PNG/TIFF files in an input directory and save to an output directory
python main.py <input_directory> --output <output_directory>

# Process a single image file
python main.py <path_to_image.png> --output <output_directory>

# Use accurate (slower) text cleaning which includes grammar checks
python main.py <input_directory> --output <output_directory> --accurate

# Show help
python main.py --help
```

### Command Line Options

- `input`: Input image file or directory containing PNG/TIFF files (required)
- `-o`, `--output`: Output directory for text files (default: same as input's parent)
- `--accurate`: Use more accurate (slower) processing, enabling language tool checks

## Input

Expects a directory of files (PNG, TIFF, or PDF) generated by the `save_screenshot` module.

## Output

Creates `.txt` files in the specified output directory (`dataset/acquisition/temp/text_data/` when run via the pipeline), mirroring the input image file structure.

## Dependencies

- `pytesseract`: Python-Tesseract OCR tool.
- `Pillow`: Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork for image processing.
- `pypdf`: For PDF text extraction.
- `language-tool-python`: For advanced text cleaning and grammar checks (optional, used in accurate mode).
- Tesseract OCR engine: Must be installed on the system (see Tesseract documentation for installation).

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Tesseract OCR engine installed and configured in your system's PATH.
- `pytesseract` and `Pillow` are listed in the main `requirements.txt`.
- `language-tool-python` is listed in the main `requirements.txt`.
