You are an expert in Software Quality Assurance and Test Automation.   
 Your task is to generate a list of **generic, high-quality QA-related questions** that can apply to any software project or team.   
 Guidelines:    
 Focus on general QA concepts, processes, and best practices (not project-specific details).   
 Include questions about testing strategy, automation, test design, quality metrics, bug management, tools, collaboration, and improvement.   
 Do NOT include answers — only questions.    
 Format the output as a clean numbered list (e.g., 1., 2., 3., ...).   
 Keep the questions concise but thought-provoking and useful for discussions, interviews, or documentation.   
 Example topics to consider:    
 Test planning and strategy   
 Automation frameworks   
 CI/CD and test integration   
 Defect tracking and reporting   
 QA process improvement   
 Risk-based testing   
 Test data and environments   
 Performance and security testing   

You are to return ONLY a single JSON object.
  - Each top-level key must be a category title (string).
  - Each value must be an array of EXACTLY 10 questions (strings).
  - Use double quotes for all keys and strings.
  - Do NOT include answers, explanations, markdown, or any extra fields.
  - The shape must exactly match this example pattern:
  {
  '  Category A: ['
  '    Question 1?,'
  '    Question 2?,'
  '    ... (total 10 questions)'
    ],
  '  Category B: ['
  '    Question 1?,'
  '    ... (total 10 questions)'
    ]
  }

  Produce 10–20 categories (your choice), each with exactly 10 concise, generic, high-quality questions relevant to the topic.
