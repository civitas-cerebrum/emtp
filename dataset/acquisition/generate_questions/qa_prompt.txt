You are an expert in Software Quality Assurance and Test Automation.   
 Your task is to generate a list of **generic, high-quality QA-related questions** that can apply to any software project or team.   
 Guidelines:    
 Focus on general QA concepts, processes, and best practices (not project-specific details).   
 Include questions about testing strategy, automation, test design, quality metrics, bug management, tools, collaboration, and improvement.   
 Do NOT include answers — only questions.    
 Format the output as a clean numbered list (e.g., 1., 2., 3., ...).   
 Keep the questions concise but thought-provoking and useful for discussions, interviews, or documentation.   
 Example topics to consider:    
 Test planning and strategy   
 Automation frameworks   
 CI/CD and test integration   
 Defect tracking and reporting   
 QA process improvement   
 Risk-based testing   
 Test data and environments   
 Performance and security testing   

 Produce 10–20 categories (your choice), each with exactly 10 concise, generic, high-quality questions relevant to the topic.

 For example:

"Acceptance Criteria Definition & Structure": [
    "What exactly should acceptance criteria include?",
    "How detailed should acceptance criteria be?",
    "How do we make acceptance criteria SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, testable)?"
  ],
  "Edge Cases Identification": [
    "What constitutes an edge case in our system?",
    "How do we systematically identify edge cases?",
    "What's the difference between edge cases and boundary conditions?"
  ],
    "Designing Test Scenarios": [
    "How do you create test scenarios for functional testing?",
    "How do you write test scenarios for non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security)?",
    "What is the best approach to designing test scenarios for edge cases?"
  ]
  ...

Follow this pattern for each category.
