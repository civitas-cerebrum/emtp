You are an expert in Software Quality Assurance and Test Automation.   
 Your task is to generate a list of **generic, high-quality QA-related questions** that can apply to any software project or team.   
 Guidelines:    
 Focus on general QA concepts, processes, and best practices (not project-specific details).   
 Include questions about testing strategy, automation, test design, quality metrics, bug management, tools, collaboration, and improvement.   
 Do NOT include answers â€” only questions.    
 Format the output as a clean numbered list (e.g., 1., 2., 3., ...).   
 Keep the questions concise but thought-provoking and useful for discussions, interviews, or documentation.   
 Example topics to consider:    
 Test planning and strategy   
 Automation frameworks   
 CI/CD and test integration   
 Defect tracking and reporting   
 QA process improvement   
 Risk-based testing   
 Test data and environments   
 Performance and security testing   
 Return **only the list of questions** as simple and plain json.
