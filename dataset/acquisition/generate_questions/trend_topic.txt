You are to return ONLY a single JSON object.
  - Each top-level key must be a category title (string).
  - Each value must be an array of EXACTLY 10 questions (strings).
  - Use double quotes for all keys and strings.
  - Do NOT include answers, explanations, markdown, or any extra fields.
  - The shape must exactly match this example pattern:
  {
  '  Category A: ['
  '    Question 1?,'
  '    Question 2?,'
  '    ... (total 10 questions)'
    ],
  '  Category B: ['
  '    Question 1?,'
  '    ... (total 10 questions)'
    ]
  }
