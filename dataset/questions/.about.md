# Questions Management

This module manages the structured questions used throughout the EMTP pipeline. It contains question templates and utilities for question processing.

## Current Content

- `qa_questions.json`: Comprehensive collection of QA-related questions organized by categories
- Questions cover topics like acceptance criteria, edge cases, test design, automation, and more
- Unicode characters have been normalized for proper processing

## Usage

The questions are loaded by the URL retrieval stage to find relevant web content. The `qa_questions.json` file serves as the input for the entire data acquisition pipeline.

## Future Development

This module may be expanded to include:
- Dynamic question generation
- Question categorization and filtering
- Question quality assessment
- Integration with external question sources
