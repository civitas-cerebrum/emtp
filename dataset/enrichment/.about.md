# Data Enrichment

This module processes the acquired raw data (URLs and screenshots) to create enriched, semi-synthetic training data suitable for model training.

## Current Status

This module is currently a placeholder for future development. It will process data from `dataset/acquisition/temp/` and prepare it for the training pipeline.

## Planned Features

- Data cleaning and normalization
- Feature extraction from screenshots
- Text extraction and processing
- Data augmentation techniques
- Format conversion for training
