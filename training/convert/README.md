# Model Conversion

This module is a component of the `training/` stage within the Expert Model Training Pipeline (EMTP). It is responsible for post-training processes, specifically for quantizing and converting the trained output model into the GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format) format. This ensures compatibility and optimized performance for deployment with various inference engines, such as `llama.cpp`.

## Current Status

This module is currently a placeholder for future development. It will take a trained model as input and perform the necessary quantization and conversion steps.

## Planned Features

- Integration with popular model quantization libraries (e.g., `bitsandbytes`, `AWQ`).
- Support for various model architectures and frameworks.
- Generation of GGUF formatted models with different quantization levels (e.g., Q4_0, Q5_K_M).
- Validation of converted models for integrity and performance.

## Dependencies

Specific dependencies for model quantization and GGUF conversion will be added to `requirements.txt` when this module is implemented.
