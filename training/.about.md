# Model Training

This module handles the training of expert models using the enriched data from the acquisition and enrichment stages.

## Current Status

This module is currently a placeholder for future development. It will consume processed data from `dataset/enrichment/` and train machine learning models.

## Planned Features

- Model architecture definition
- Training pipeline implementation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation and validation
- Checkpointing and model saving
- Integration with popular ML frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.)

## Dependencies

Training dependencies will be added to `requirements.txt` when this module is implemented.
